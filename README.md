app provides comparable sustainability info to help individuals minimize their carbon footprint


1. How do we want to parse data --- Lets define our input format(s) and output -- IN: Menu item? XX quantity of XXX product? OUT: Carbon Footprint calculation
2. Data is not complete. Depending on our input, we likely want kg Co2/oz, but that number is not yet filled out (Not huge problem)
3. Do we want to factor in cost somewhere? Do we care about that? What would we be selling here? More expensive for more c02 footprint bad is easy sell, but if more $ for less c02 footprint why do this?
4. some of this data seems sketch A F ----Example: Meal, eating out red meat. I guess it doesn't matter that much if all we care about is the comparison of meals we eat out on, but want to note sketchnes

5. Treeline stuff seems pretty good. We can totally start there



Next steps:
Where do we want this? Ios and Android (two different platforms with different code)
API? What is the architecture we want? Honestly I think it would probs be best to just make something that works first
menu scraping for the business you are in? would be way cool - integrate with google api?
